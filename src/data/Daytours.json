   "description": "Within a little less than two hours drive from Reykjavík is Eyjafjallajökull glacier, and just a little further the Sólheimajökull glacier tongue extends down from Mýrdalsjökull, Iceland´s fourth largest glacier.A glacier hike is a great way to experience Icelandic nature. We take an easy glacier walk on crampons up on to the ice field where a wonderland of ice sculptures, ridges and deep crevasses awaits discovery. During the hike you learn more about these disappearing giants. We will provide and teach you how to use basic glacier equipment for this tour. On the way back we make two stops, at the striking waterfalls Skógafoss and Seljalandsfoss.",
